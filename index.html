        Facial Recognition (FR) and other biometric applications have recently gained importance in smart city development. FR is developing technologies with real-time applications. This project uses transfer learning in cloud and fog computing to build an FR system. Various conditions such as occlusions, facial expressions, lighting, and angles affect performance. These features help in comparing faces effectively. The system can be trained online, improving as it learns from new and old faces, making better predictions over time. ML algorithms like Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are also used.
